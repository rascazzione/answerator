# answerator
A web application to help teams quickly create and search for information.

## Goal
Facilitate knowledge sharing while creating a knowledge database for future newcomers of your project/team.

## Backgroud and strategic fit

 - We have a lot of information that is difficult to find among a lot of documentation.
 - When an employee/collegue does not know something, he or she usually asks other colleagues for the information. Question after question the same requests are repeated for the new generations. So we would like to offer a database to make automatic answers to the same questions.
 - If the question has been asked before, the system will show the previous answers. So we will be more productive because old employees will not waste time answering the same questions multiple times
